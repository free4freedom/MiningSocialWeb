>NOTE : the 'created_at' time is UTC.

1.So to get all news update of say - Aug 5th, u should get tweets since - Aug 4th 19:30 [ Because +5:30 UTC ]
2.Once u have all the tweets, classify it into some category - Sports, Politics, Bollywood etc

3.Then many of the tweets in every category might be repeated or telling same thing. Try to eliminate the repetitions.
4. Finally use the favorite & retweet count to decide the ranking.

	//More flexibilty
	>Take input from user, since when he wants the tweets. [ Bcoz I may run the app 5 times a day! ]
	>Take the input from user - from which newspaper it wants.
